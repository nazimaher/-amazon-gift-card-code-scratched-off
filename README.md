1. Stop Scratching Immediately
If you realize the code is starting to get damaged while scratching, stop right away. You may still be able to read some characters, which could help identify the code later.

2. Check the Packaging and Receipt
Before you panic, double-check the packaging and receipt. Some gift cards (especially those purchased at retail stores) come with the code printed elsewhere ‚Äî sometimes on the receipt or inside the packaging.

3. Try to Guess or Reconstruct the Code
Amazon gift card codes are typically a mix of letters and numbers, 14-15 characters long. If only a few characters are damaged, you might be able to guess or reconstruct them using the remaining legible parts.

4. Contact Amazon Customer Support
If the code is completely unreadable, your best option is to contact Amazon‚Äôs Customer Service. You can do this by:

Visiting the Amazon Help Center

Selecting ‚ÄúGift Cards‚Äù as the issue

Providing the following information:

A photo of the damaged card (front and back)

The gift card‚Äôs serial number (usually found on the back)

The original receipt, if available

Details of where and when you purchased it

Amazon may be able to verify the card‚Äôs balance and issue a replacement or apply the balance directly to your account.

5. Be Patient and Polite
Customer service reps are more likely to help if you explain the situation calmly and clearly. If the card is legitimate and you provide the right proof, they‚Äôll usually be able to resolve the issue.

Final Thoughts
A scratched-off Amazon gift card code can be a headache, but it‚Äôs not the end of the road. With some patience and a little effort, there‚Äôs a good chance you can recover your balance and start shopping again. Always scratch gently in the future ‚Äî better safe than sorry!
